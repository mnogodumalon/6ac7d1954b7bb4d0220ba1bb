/**
 * Occupancy semantics — DECIDED BY THE BUILD AGENT, never by a heuristic.
 *
 * The Phase-2 orchestrator writes its decision to `.intents-staging/occupancy.json`
 * (stay pair, booked resource, statuses that do not occupy); the integration
 * step validates it against the app metadata and renders it into the block
 * below. Scaffold updates keep the block. Do not edit outside the markers.
 *
 * Both doors read this and nothing else: `occupancyFor` (internal flows AND
 * public pages) and the owner service (the public grant's occupancy read).
 * No rule for an entity = no availability calendar, no occupancy claim —
 * a plain date field pair is shown instead.
 *
 * Facts from the metadata — candidates, NOT decisions:
 *   - sender: lookups senderkategorie[oeffentlich_rechtlich|privat|nachrichten|sport|spartenkanal]
 *   - sendungen: date pairs beginn+ende · applookups sender→sender · lookups genre[spielfilm|serie|nachrichten|dokumentation|sport|show|kinder|unterhaltung], altersfreigabe[ab_0|ab_6|ab_12|ab_16|ab_18]
